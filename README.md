## Overview

Transcript Editor is a tool originally designed for creating transcripts for research purposes for the PADRES Lab at UCSB. It offers several features to facilitate the transcription process:

- **Formatting**: The tool automatically makes interviewer lines bold when question marks are used in conjunction with timestamps.

- **Annotations**: You can use square brackets to add comments, annotations, or descriptions within the transcript. For example, [LAUGHTER] can be used to denote moments of laughter.

- **User Interface**: The interface consists of a textarea for text input/editing and a div element for displaying the formatted transcript.

- **Controls**: It provides audio control buttons for managing audio playback. You can also use buttons to add "I:" and "P:" prefixes for interviewer and participant lines, respectively. Additionally, there's a button for inserting brackets and another for adding timestamps.

## Usage

1. Use the textarea to input or edit the transcript text.
2. Apply formatting and annotations as needed using the provided buttons.
