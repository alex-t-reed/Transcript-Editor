# Transcript Editor

[Transcript Editor](https://alex-t-reed.github.io/transcripteditor)

This is a transcript editor I used to make transcripts for participants as a research assistant.

It bolds interviewer lines with question marks only if a timestamp is placed.

It also can input [COMMENTS LIKE THESE] to account for things like [LAUGHTER].

It uses a textarea for input and a div element to display the formatted transcript.

There are audio control buttons, buttons to add I: and P: into the text (interviewer/participant), a button to include brackets, and a button to include a timestamp.
